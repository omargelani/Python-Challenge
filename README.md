The purpose of this project was to anaylyze a company's financial data that they have provided to me. It was uploaded in "csv" formate. 
As you can see in this repo, it is sectioned off in different folders - to see the main script, please go to the "Main" Folder where you can see my Python Script used to analyze the csv file. 
Additionally, what my Python script has outputted can be seen under a different folder labeled analysis where you can see the companies financial data such as "Greatest Loss" and "Greatest increase".
